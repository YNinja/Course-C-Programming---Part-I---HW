Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list 
with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar 
are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?

Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five 
languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.



The next list shows the most popular languages today based on combined results
from different data sets.

1.C
2.Java
3.PHP
4.JavaScript
5.C++
6.Python
7.Shell

C# language was released in 2001 by Microsoft as the new "C - like" object-oriented 
language. At least that was the idea. In time the languages have proven to have little
in common. One thing that kept the line of Microsoft products thoug was the "#" in the
name.

C# is a powerful cutting edge language wich allows full object-oriented code to be build
while C is a relatively small language and does not offer object-oriented programming.
Even though C# code shares the C/C++ style it is really closer to JAVA.

C# and JAVA both use garbage-collection and are designed with semi-interpretation or
runtime compilation in ming.

PHP as a server side scripting language is great if you want to creat dynamic pages. C#
is multi functional and can be used not only for building Windows programs but complex
web sites as well. So it all depends on the project specification.

JavaScript has a lot lesss parts than C#. In C# the functions have to be attached to a 
class. In JavaScript they don't. And t all comes from the different language definition.
