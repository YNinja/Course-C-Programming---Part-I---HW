code too.

Netbeans

It's extensible Development Environment that complies code. Comes for free, but 
slows down the computer.

a regular text edit. The program uses Linux. Offers code folding wich is great 
advantage at some point. But kate aslo requires a lot of free space and does not 
compile code.

casually edit code in small projects. The program uses Linux. Offers code 
highlighting and tabbed function. Does't compile code.
